# GoLang To-Do List Web App

This is a simple to-do list web application built with GoLang. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, making it an ideal project for learning web development with GoLang.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Read Tasks**: View all tasks in the to-do list.
- **Update Tasks**: Edit task details, such as the task name and its completion status.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list when completed or no longer needed.
- **Persistent Data**: Tasks are stored persistently, ensuring they are available after the web server is restarted.
- **Simple User Interface**: Clean and intuitive design for easy task management.

## Technologies Used

- **GoLang**: For server-side logic.
- **HTML/CSS**: For building the user interface.
- **SQLite**: For simple task data storage.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design.
